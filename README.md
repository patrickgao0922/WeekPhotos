# Configuration

## Step 1. run pod install to install all necessary pods

## Step 2 Add Imgur client id  into Config.xcconfig file

There is a config file template called Config_Temp.xcconfig in directory WeekPhotos/Conig Files/ .

Change that file name to Config.xcconfig and replace <IMGUR_CLIENT_ID> with imgur client id. (IMGUR_CLIENT_SECRET is not needed because the project only obtain the images)

## Step 3 WeekPhotos.xcworkspace to start the project

## Make sure that the scheme is using debug configuration (Don't have to change)
